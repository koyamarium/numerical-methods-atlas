# An Atlas of Numerical Methods

**Read the paper. Understand the method. Run the benchmark.**

A historical, executable guide to numerical algorithms: the equations they solve,
the ideas behind their discretizations, and the evidence used to check them.
This is the **first edition, v0.1.0**, and a companion to
[The Art of Thermal Instability](https://koyamahr.github.io/the-art-of-thermal-instability/#home).

Explore the [historical atlas](docs/history.md), run the Python examples, and
compare the results with analytical solutions and conservation checks. The
library covers selected educational models; the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
identifies the extensions still to be implemented.

**[Read the published atlas](https://koyamahr.github.io/numerical-methods-atlas/)** — published November 6, 2026. The former address forwards language, chapter, section and search parameters to this edition. Source and ongoing development: [koyamahr/numerical-methods-atlas](https://github.com/koyamahr/numerical-methods-atlas). See the [migration record and rollback information](URL_MIGRATION.md).

## Finding your way

The homepage maps the atlas through six overlapping areas: foundations and
stability, waves and compressible flow, diffusion and elliptic problems, high
order and meshes, particles and kinetic methods, and coupled applications.
Selecting an area connects its models, methods and verification exhibits.
Three reading routes help first-time visitors, method comparisons and source
reading. The shared catalog supplies the counts, and each exhibit states its
scope. The Sod comparison remains available below the map.

## Getting started

Requires Python 3.9 or later.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install '.[test]'
python -m pytest -q
python -m numart.cli gallery --output outputs/gallery
```

For an existing environment, start with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
Figures, numerical data, settings, and source SHA-256 hashes are saved together.
Runs made before the first Git commit record a `null` Git revision and use the
source hashes to identify the implementation.

## The atlas in numbers — published edition

**42 equation/model entries · 90 numerical methods and building blocks ·
136 journal/conference papers · 158 unique sources in all.**

The paper count is 133 journal articles plus 3 conference papers; other sources
include books, chapters, reports, documentation and a separately identified
preprint. The named inventory distinguishes 15 model entries and 84 method
entries with scoped local examples from reading-only material. These are not
counts of independent, complete production solvers. The equation gallery has
9 saved-profile cases across 7 families.

[Inspect the full inventory and counting rules](docs/site-coverage.md).
Counts are regenerated from the catalogs during the Web build. A duplicate
Cockburn–Shu record was merged; Dahlquist (1963) was subsequently added for
the [A/L stability and error-norm guide](docs/accuracy-stability.md).

## Reading guide

Additional reading: [time integration and leapfrog](docs/time-integration.md), [meshes](docs/meshes.md), [SPH](docs/particles-sph.md), [ALE](docs/ale.md), [cylindrical tensors and viscosity](docs/coordinates-viscosity.md), [Double Mach Reflection](docs/double-mach.md), [carbuncle](docs/carbuncle.md), and [Remembering Philip L. Roe](docs/roe-memorial.md).

Further reading: [symplectic Hamiltonian maps](docs/symplectic.md), [PM / P³M / Tree / multipoles](docs/particle-gravity.md), and [Hockney–Eastwood / Koyama–Ostriker gravity kernels](docs/gravity-boundaries.md).

Source-based additions: [Inutsuka's GSPH and its MHD/SR extensions](docs/gsph.md)
and [the development of SRHD, GRHD, and GRMHD through November 2026](docs/relativistic-hydrodynamics.md).
These are reading notes and staged implementation plans; no GSPH or relativistic
fluid solver is implemented in the current library.

New exhibits: [CIP value/gradient transport](docs/cip.md), [Runge–Kutta families](docs/runge-kutta.md), [slope limiters](docs/limiters.md), [advanced TVB and positive-state scaling](docs/advanced-limiters.md), [nonsteady movies](docs/movies.md), and [original KEEP with smooth tests and caveats](docs/keep.md). Steady fields remain still figures.

## Current priority: shock methods

[Reconstruction and flux comparisons](https://koyamahr.github.io/numerical-methods-atlas/#/reconstruction) add limited parabolic FV, conservative characteristics, FD WENO-Z and a defined AUSM-family baseline. [Stationary odd–even shock diagnostics](https://koyamahr.github.io/numerical-methods-atlas/#/shock-robustness) compare six flux settings, two grids, two shock positions and unperturbed controls. [Roe's Property U](docs/advanced.md#roes-property-u) has parameter-vector and single-wave checks, including an entropy counterexample. Original PPM tracing/steepening/flattening, AUSM+/AUSM+-up and blunt-body/rotated-hybrid tests remain the next steps before new subject areas.

## Euler reconstruction and full-vector MHD comparisons

[Compare first order, minmod and MC](https://koyamahr.github.io/numerical-methods-atlas/#/flow-comparison) on the NASA wedges and forward step, with exact-cell-average smooth refinement and paired 81-state step clips. [HLLD standard tests](https://koyamahr.github.io/numerical-methods-atlas/#/mhd-tests) add Brio–Wu, circular Alfvén refinement and weak field loops with CT-Contact/GLM diagnostics. Run `python scripts/build_euler_comparison.py` and `python scripts/build_mhd_tests.py` with the movie dependencies to regenerate source-hashed artifacts. Scope and remaining verification are documented in [the NASA chapter](docs/nasa-2d.md) and [the MHD chapter](docs/mhd.md).

## Local expansion: equation gallery and solver foundations

The prepared Web edition adds an **Equations** route (`#/equations`): Burgers
shock/fan, LWR traffic jam/clearing fan, advection, heat, Sod, wet dam break and
isothermal flow. This expansion is prepared locally and has not been deployed.

New verified models: [continuous P1 FEM](docs/fem.md),
[GMRES / BiCGSTAB / ILU / Newton](docs/sparse-nonlinear.md),
[stiff and adaptive integration](docs/stiff-integration.md),
[periodic MAC projection](docs/incompressible.md),
[D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann](docs/lattice-boltzmann.md), and
[Nishikawa-inspired hyperbolic diffusion](docs/hyperbolic-diffusion.md).
The [Chapman–Enskog derivation](docs/chapman-enskog.md) explains the lattice
viscosity correction. See [equation definitions and sampling](docs/equation-gallery.md).

```bash
python scripts/build_equation_gallery.py
python -m pytest tests/test_sparse_fem.py tests/test_new_models.py
cd website
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Additional local reading: [22 biological model families](docs/biological-models.md)
with source equations and proposed benchmarks (survey only), and
[Arakawa A/B/C grids](docs/geophysical-grids.md) with placement diagrams
and tested linear rotating-shallow-water Fourier symbols.

## Run a benchmark

```bash
python -m numart.cli run sod --method muscl --riemann roe --n 200
python -m numart.cli run double-mach --n 64 --cfl 0.4 --output outputs/double-mach
python -m numart.cli run lax --method muscl --riemann hllc --n 200
python -m numart.cli run shu-osher --method weno5 --n 400
python -m numart.cli run entropy-wave --method weno5 --n 160
python -m numart.cli run double-rarefaction --method godunov --riemann hlle --n 200
python -m numart.cli run dam-break --riemann hll --n 200
python -m numart.cli run isothermal --riemann hll --n 200
python -m numart.cli run orszag-tang --method ct --n 64 --output outputs/ct
python -m numart.cli run orszag-tang --method glm --n 64 --output outputs/glm
```

`run` writes numerical arrays and a `run.json` manifest. `gallery` generates
comparison figures. Reusing an output directory overwrites its files; use a
separate `--output` for each result you want to retain.
WENO uses global Lax–Friedrichs flux splitting and ignores `--riemann`.

The same methods are available from Python:

```python
from numart import get_problem, solve
from numart.advection import dg_advection, dual_time_advection
from numart.linear import diffusion_1d, poisson_1d, poisson_2d, Boundary, poisson_boundary_1d
from numart.multigrid import solve_poisson_multigrid
import numpy as np

r = solve(get_problem("sod"), n=200, method="muscl", riemann="hllc")
x, u, modes = dg_advection(n=32, degree=2)
x, u, settings = diffusion_1d(method="crank-nicolson", dt=0.001)
x, u = poisson_boundary_1d(63, -2., Boundary.dirichlet(1.), Boundary.neumann(2.))
u, residual = solve_poisson_multigrid(np.ones((63, 63)))
```

## First-edition gallery

![Sod shock tube compared with the exact Riemann solution](docs/figures/sod.png)

![Discontinuous Galerkin and Fourier advection examples](docs/figures/dg-spectral.png)

![Orszag–Tang vortex: CT and GLM educational implementations](docs/figures/orszag-tang.png)

These figures come from independent educational implementations. They do not
claim to reproduce the original papers' figures. CT and GLM use different
discrete operators and dissipation; magnetic-divergence values alone do not
establish which method is more accurate.

## Implemented in the current first edition

- **Finite differences:** forward, backward, centered, and upwind stencils; Lax–Friedrichs, Lax–Wendroff, and componentwise FD WENO5-JS.
- **Finite volumes:** piecewise-constant Godunov-type updates and primitive-variable slope-limited MUSCL; Rusanov, HLL, HLLE, HLLC, and Roe fluxes.
- **Discontinuous Galerkin:** periodic linear advection with modal Legendre P0/P1/P2, upwind fluxes, and SSPRK3.
- **Spectral methods:** periodic Fourier advection and diffusion, exact integration of linear modes, and Fourier differentiation.
- **Smooth KEEP:** original second-order arithmetic-mean Cartesian Euler flux with RK4, periodic isentropic-vortex refinement and explicit entropy/shock/PEP caveats.
- **2D Euler:** first-order HLL + SSPRK2 Double Mach Reflection with time-dependent shock and reflecting-wall boundaries.
- **Temporal and geometric models:** twelve scalar ODE integrators, explicit mesh connectivity, 1D SPH reconstruction, and a moving-volume ALE identity check.
- **Cylindrical tensors:** orthonormal velocity gradient, Newtonian stress with bulk viscosity, and symmetric stress divergence at r > 0.
- **Particle gravity:** periodic 3D CIC/FFT PM; isolated softened octree with monopole or second moments; isolated doubled-grid and periodic-horizontal/vacuum-vertical slab convolution. Full P³M, TreePM, and FMM remain reading directions.
- **Hamiltonian maps:** fixed-step symplectic Euler, Verlet, Yoshida fourth order, implicit midpoint, and RK4 comparisons for harmonic/quartic oscillators.
- **MHD:** planar 2D ideal MHD with first-order Rusanov fluxes, staggered constrained transport, and cell-centered GLM cleaning.
- **Diffusion and elliptic equations:** FTCS, backward Euler, Crank–Nicolson, 1D Thomas elimination, and 2D matrix-free conjugate gradients.
- **Iterative methods:** Jacobi, Gauss–Seidel, and SOR iteration matrices; red-black relaxation; and geometric multigrid V-cycles.
- **Minimal advanced models:** BDF1/BDF2 dual time stepping, symmetric Jacobi scaling, and 1D scalar residual distribution.

Multidimensional Euler rotated-hybrid fluxes, low-Mach PDE preconditioning,
2D residual distribution, and Euler/MHD DG remain future work. The NASA airfoil,
boundary-layer, and separated-flow catalog requires additional Navier–Stokes or
RANS solvers, meshes, and wall treatments.

## Verification and reproducibility

The test suite checks flux consistency, exact solutions, selected convergence
orders, periodic conservation, selected positivity cases, CT divergence
preservation, GLM error cleaning, linear-system residuals, boundary conditions,
and multigrid. These checks establish behavior for the tested cases; they do
not prove general positivity or nonlinear stability.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/koyamahr/the-art-of-numerical-algorithms/actions)
runs the numerical checks and gallery generation on Python 3.9 and 3.12.
Bibliographic notes record whether a source is an original paper, a later
exposition, or a reference that still needs direct inspection. Regenerate the
reference list and BibTeX together with:

```bash
python scripts/build_references.py
```

## Build the web edition

The static website lives in [`website/`](website/README.md). It renders the current
reading chapters and their equations, includes the computed gallery and saved-state movies, and uses
precomputed library results for the interactive Sod comparison. See the web
README for local preview and content-refresh commands.

Regenerate the new geometric and gravity exhibits before syncing the web content:

```bash
python scripts/build_hamiltonian.py
python scripts/build_particle_gravity.py
python scripts/build_gravity_boundaries.py
python scripts/build_limiters.py
python scripts/build_runge_kutta.py
python scripts/build_cip.py
python scripts/sync_web_content.py
```

Build and verify the nonsteady movies (optional MP4 encoder):

```bash
python -m pip install '.[movies]'
python scripts/build_keep.py
python scripts/build_movies.py
python scripts/check_movies.py
python scripts/sync_web_content.py
```

## Published bilingual edition

English title: **An Atlas of Numerical Methods**. Japanese title: **数値計算法アトラス**. Both languages use the published `numerical-methods-atlas/` address.

The published edition supports Japanese/English switching and 143 bilingual terms. Japanese drafts cover 42 of the 43 reading chapters; the new reference-element basis chapter and notebook currently use English. Established experiment notebooks have Japanese controls and explanations. Original bibliography metadata, source notes and image/video lettering remain shared. The drafts still need editorial review. See [implementation status](BILINGUAL_STATUS.md) and the [original migration plan](BILINGUAL_PLAN.md).

Reference-element basis functions now have a dedicated [chapter](docs/basis-functions.md) and [interactive notebook](https://koyamahr.github.io/numerical-methods-atlas/#/basis): Legendre modes, nodal Lagrange functions, Gauss/GLL quadrature, exact versus lumped mass, and triangular P1/P2 shapes. Other orthogonal families are explained with their domains and weights.

**Planned extension: quantum chemistry and DFT.** The [development checklist](docs/roadmap.md#planned-quantum-chemistry-and-dft) records Schrödinger eigenproblems, electronic-structure bases, Coulomb/Hartree potentials, Hartree–Fock, Kohn–Sham DFT, SCF mixing and verification examples. Implementation and a dedicated literature review have not started; no release date is assigned.
